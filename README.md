    * <span style="color:#a6e3a1">**Green text**</span> when you win.
    * <span style="color:#f38ba8">**Red text**</span> when you lose.
    * <span style="color:#f9e2af">**Yellow text**</span> for ties.
* **Scoreboard:** Keeps track of Player vs. Computer wins in real-time.
* **Reset Function:** A dedicated button to wipe the scoreboard and start fresh.
